    "summary": "This is outlined in Coronation\u2019s July 2024 Correspondent, where economist Marie Antelme and ESG analyst Leila Joseph say that \u201cwater security is arguably one of the most critical risks to South Africa\u2019s social, economic, and political long-term future.\u201d Households and businesses across South Africa are struggling with water stress worsened by climate change and municipal infrastructure challenges, impacting the availability of sufficient, usable water required to operate. The fund manager\u2019s study showed that water security emerged as the most concerning environmental issue for their clients, with 78% of respondents indicating that this should be prioritised by investors in 2024. On top of examples of poor planning and management, significant underinvestment in infrastructure which has seen it rapidly deteriorate, vandalism and corruption, the water-scarce country\u2019s risk is exacerbated by climate change. Antelme and Joseph highlight that with an average annual rainfall of just 460mm\u2014less than half the global average\u2014rainfall distribution is uneven and highly concentrated in just 8% of the land."
